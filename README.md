In simple eords, **WordleGame** is an international game where player should guess the right word in six tries. In other words, there are 6 rows and each row has 5 square for a 5 letter meaningful word. The word itself should not be an acrynom or a person name. 

If player guessed a right letter at right positon, the game board square and the keyboard key will be turned to a green.

If player guessed a right letter at wrong position, the game board square as will as the keyboard key will be turned into yellow.

If player's guess is neither a right letter or at right position, then game board square and the keyboard key will be gray coloured.

Wordle Game is also responsive and load like in the following **am I responsive here** [wordle-Game](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://alalimazen.github.io/Wordle-Game/)

# UX
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Wordle game has the theme which resembles the traffic lights. From the first glance I thought it like so, wheever the letter turns green, go with this letter at the same position. Whenever it is yellow, prepare yourself to use this letter but on a different position. Thought Red Light doesn't fit in, rather it is gray which is nto that intuitive for player indicating that this letter is not included in the word. 

I think in the future, I will repace the gray color with a soft red color for indicating a warning not to use this letter again. Red color has the characteristics that it refers to something either not good or even wrong. Discussing this topic with my friends, thy find the gray color not that suitable for this indication and that is why I will properly replace it with soft red color from the color platte I used in the whole game.

## Target Audience
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- On one side, this game targets English learners whi want to test their knowledge to guess 5 letter words based on the game board which is very helpful.

- On the other side, it targets the junior developers who want to test their understanding of JavaScript and the interactivity between UI (HTML and CSS) amd backend with (JS).

## Project Goals
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- Mainyl is the ability to have interaction between end user and the website. Project Goal for Wordle Game is to take user choice, process it and get the consequence of that choice. 

- Another goald is to build a game which is internationally known but with a differnt code base. The idea is not to repeat the same code and have a code clone, but rather to build this game with a different code base and as simple as possible make it possible for future learner to know that it is still possible and can even be improved.

## User Stories
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

### Site User Stories
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Many of my friends reposrted that the game is very interestting but it should have some features like giving hints about the random word which can make is easier to anticpate the game. This feature is a good feature to have in the future as I am also conveniced about it.


### Developer Stories
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- As a developer I have though, it is going to be difficult to implement the logic of the wordle game, but it turns to be not that hard after making use of the functinos and instrcution shown by the JS Essentials by Code Institue. I could understand the Game logic and I started implementing the fuctions on after another as the module goes on. It is worth mentioning that searching the web for JS is very helpful and overwohlming at the same time. 

## Design Choices
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Your site is most likely geared to a certain audience, and your design choices should tie into them. Let the assessors know your thought process.


You may want to re-watch the videos about the [5 planes of UX development ](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/9c295bdc5a4048308460e262b14ab7df/) when writing up this section

### Typography
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- Because each user key stroke is going to be a single letter, I paid special attention for a font which is soft and clear even when small letter is used. 

- Font family is 'Nato Sans', which belongs to sans-serif and taken from Google font under [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) with following weights:

    - 100
    - 200
    - 300
    - 400
    - 500
    - 600
    - 700
    - 800
    - 900

    with bold style.
- Tests on the font includes using small capital i and small l like in Illuminate, for example. 

### Imagery
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**
Two main images I have brough from Pexels for using as Background for the 404 page. These images are also hat the topic which is related in a way or another on brainstorming for guessing words.

### Animations and Transitions
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- I have implemented the transform attribute from JavaScript to give the game board special effect after a word is submitted. The row gets colored and then it rotates from 0 to 90 to 180 to 360 

- After the game ends regardless if player has won the game or lost, the on-screen keyboard key gets the same totating effect from the game board to be restted. 

## Design Elements
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

While player playes the game, it is possible to switch the backgrund music on or off. The icon of volumn in at the top game screen is connected to a JS function that turns backgriund music on and off. The Icon itself will also be changed reflecting the status of the music. Based on the status of music, the corresponding icon will be shown.

## Wireframes
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Wireframes are done using the Balsamiq software licesned by Code Institute and I have made a wireframe for **desktop** and **mobile devices** and both can be found under the assets/wireframes .


### Features
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Right from the beginning when the game loads, it starts by showing user a set of instructions on how ot play and what color has which meaning. After touching or clicking on **OK** button, the game board and the on-screen keyboard  and in the middle there is a scoring calculation tracker. 

### Implemented Features
ðŸš¨**Required** 

- Instruction window: When game load at the first stage, it opens up with a how-to-play instructions. This window is connected to Javascript file through a ducntion responsible to hide this window and show the game UI.

- On the top of the gameboard there are two incons on is lillte i circle used to show the instructions and hide the whole game UI elements and hid it again to show the game UI. 

- Next to the instructions icon there is a volum icon. When clicked a background music will start playing help player to listen to music while playing. The same icon is also used to pause the backgriund music.


- Gamebaord: a grid UI of 5 squares and 6 rows. Whenever player is ready with aguess of a word, player can click on **Submit** key to check the typed word against the random selected word.

- Coloring Gameboard: when letter is at right position, square will be turned into green. When letter is at wrong position but still included in the random word, square will be turned into yellow. When letter is not included in the random word, square will be turned into gray. 

- Play again button: This button is going to be shown only when either play wins the game at what ever row, or when player loses without guessing the right word. **Play again** button is used to reset both game board and the on-screen keyboard. 

- Notifications: There are 3 notification while game is running. First one is when user has guesed the random word using 'window.aler()' built in function. The second notification is when player loses the game, a notification will be shown telling user that game is over and what the random word is. The last notification is shown when the size of the browser or device dimension. 

- On-screen keyboard: The keyboard is used to get the letter into the gameboard squares. The Keyboard get also colored when player has guessed right letter at right position, right letter at wrong position or not included letter to avoid these letter on the next try. 

- Animation of both game board and keyboard: When a word is submitted the row on the gameboard is rotated and gets colored from side of Javascript implemention CSS code. The same animation is applied to the keyboard keys after **play again** button. 

- Scoring: since we have a word of 5 letters, player will get 20 points for each right letter at the right position. Only 10 points for a right letter at the right position. If player gets the right word from the first try, s/he will get 100 point + 105. The 105 is so aggregated the player will lose 5 points for each row (which is considered a try) (5+10+15+20+25+2+30 =105).


## Future Features
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- One of the future feature which I would like to implement when completing the database module it to link this game to a central database and add statistics to the game to show results between different player from all over the globe.


- Gives hints after the third and fourth row about the random word. This requires to turn the words list to an object where each word can have more than one hint and its meaning when player either guessed the word games finishes up.

**Important to Note** 


Currently I have tried my best to get the UI as responsive as possible but I figured an issue related to a device called (Nest Hub) which turns to be a device from google used to manage other devices inside smart houses. The referenced device is not supposed to be used as a game device since it is fixed in a wall or welcome device at an entrance.

## Accessibility Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Testing the accessibility of the wordle game is done used the following tool provided by Google Chrome and demonstrated by Code Institute. Screenshots are taken after the test
**Lighthouse**

**Index.html** shows 100% accessibility shown in the following screenshot 
![wordle-game-index](assets/README-imgs/accessibility-index-c.png)

after loading the game baord I have run the lighthouse again to see any changes, but it shows perfect results

![wordle-game-board](assets/README-imgs/accessiblity-index-a.png)

the **404.html** page shows merely same result
